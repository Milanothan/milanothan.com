                <p>Although Mary Magdalene’s historic existence is still under debate today, Christian 
                  text from sources including the New Testament tell us that Mary of Magdala 
                  (her home village on the shore of the Sea of Gailee) played a significant role 
                  in the life of Jesus Christ and the foundations of Christianity as it is known today.
                  <br><br>
                  According to legend, Mary was one of the women that stayed with Jesus even up to 
                  crucifixion. She is said to be the first one whom Jesus appeared to after resurrection. 
                  Other early Christian texts raise her status even more in that after the death of Christ 
                  she is considered almost an apostle rivaling the status of Saint Peter.</p>
                  <p>The New Testament tells us that the followers of Christ were prosecuted  from the Holy Land after his death and many of them were forced out to sea in small ships without sail or rudder where they were left to perish on their own. The most common version of the legend states that Mary Magdalene was sent with Mary Salomé, Mary Jacobé, Martha, Lazarus, Maximin, and their Egyptian servant Sara into one of these ships.</p>

            <p>The origin of the Tarot is a mysterious and scattered history that has arguably existed in one form or another 
              since the dawn of civilization. Certainly that last sentence might raise the eyebrow of the modern historian; 
              however new research is emerging that might soon change our knowledge on the origins of Tarot.
              <br><br>
              Today tarot is mostly known by the massive variety of decks available from crystal shops and online merchants. 
              Most decks are now used for fortune telling and divination by practitioners of various faiths and beliefs.
              <br><br>
              The earliest known written records of the cards can be traced only as far back as 1367, and these records are 4
              mostly regarding the banning of the cards. The first documented origin of the cards discovered was from 
              Mamluk Sultanate, a medieval realm that covered Egypt, the Levant and Hejaz. 
              This is usually the year that modern scholars agree the cards originated, not without debate.

              <p>As someone who regularly enjoys material on ancient history, I follow a lot of groups on Facebook that post or 
              share ancient Egypt related material. From data and research to tourist photos and museum exhibits, I always 
              take a moment to appreciate the post fully.
              <br><br>
              That’s also when I inevitably glance at the comment section.
              <br><br>
              One unfortunately common cluster of comments I see on just about any post containing a human figure in an 
              ancient Egypt group is that of the race of ancient Egyptians. This often derails into a back and forth 
              string of comments that become more and more hostile as both parties try desperately to prove their side 
              with “facts” pulled from every corner of the internet.</p>
