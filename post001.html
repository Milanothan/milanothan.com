            <div class="box">               
               
                  
              
                <p>As someone who regularly enjoys material on ancient history, I follow a lot of groups on Facebook that post or share ancient Egypt related material. From data and research to tourist photos and museum exhibits, I always take a moment to appreciate the post fully. </p>
                <p>That's also when I inevitably glance at the comment section.</p>
                <p>One unfortunately common cluster of comments I see on just about any post containing a human figure in an ancient Egypt group is that of the race of ancient Egyptians. This often derails into a back and forth string of comments that become more and more hostile as both parties try desperately to prove their side with &#8220;facts&#8221; pulled from every corner of the internet.</p>
                <p>Often these arguments stem from misinformation and are filled with misconstrued views and a lack of proper understanding of the subject. It is my hope that this text will provide a basic understanding of the data we have on ancient Egyptian DNA analysis. I also hope to dispel some of the preconceived notions on race in general when it comes to ancient civilizations.</p>

                  <br>
              
                
                <p>Before we delve any further into this topic, I would like to remind the reader that all humans share 99.9% of the same common DNA.&nbsp; Science, more specifically the field of anthropology, must work outside of any prejudice thought as this will only hinder research and understanding. All cultures are full of rich histories and wonderful individuals; the human experience is a beautiful thing for this very reason. Moreover, the American Association of Physical Anthropology made a statement in 2019 [2] that attempts to explain why race is an unnecessary concept and unhelpful in the advancement of true scientific endeavors.&nbsp; I have linked to it in the references at the end of this text and highly recommend it for those interested in understanding the new scientific approach to race.</p>
                <p>However, outside of the progress being made in the scientific community,&nbsp; on Facebook the comments that often spark the most controversy are those related to the race and color of the Ancient Egyptians. This text will attempt to answer that question with the most up to date scientific and historic accuracy available. I will also provide reference wherever possible. </p>
                <p>When asked &#8220;what race were the people of ancient Egypt?&#8221; there can be no simple or clear answer.&nbsp; The history of ancient Egypt spans 30 centuries and during that time, the land of Kemet, modern day Egypt, was almost constantly sequentially conquered and reconquered by foreign enemies. Modern DNA analysis has helped shed more light on these questions, but even so, to properly understand the data one must understand that DNA analysis is a constantly evolving practice and the history we are covering spans many generations with new analysis being released regularly.</p>
                <p>The simple fact is that Egypt&#8217;s strategic location placed the people of <em>Kemet </em>on a crossroads of continents. Even before unification, around 3150 BCE,&nbsp; trade was already established with Mesopotamia (note the inspiration that the artwork of Mesopotamia had on Egypt) and eventually interaction was established between culturally significant areas in other parts of Africa as well as Asia and Europe, ranging from foreign trade to invasion.</p>
                <p>After around 1000 BCE, Egypt would have an ever increasing number of foreigners working and residing within her borders. This isn&#8217;t to mention the nearly continuous foreign invasions through history including takeover from Libyans, Assyrians, Kushites, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks and Brits.&nbsp;[1] Egypt has always been a culturally diverse land with an entanglement of genetic exchange.</p>
                <p>A study from 2017 published in Nature Communications[3] includes data from 90 mummies that were buried between 1380 BCE and 425 AD. This time span covers Egypt&#8217;s New Kingdom up to the Roman era. </p>
                <p>The scientists found that the ancient Egyptian individuals in their own dataset possessed highly similar mitochondrial profiles throughout the examined period. Both types of genomic material showed that ancient Egyptians shared little DNA with modern sub-Saharan Africans. Instead, their closest relatives were people living during the Neolithic and Bronze ages in an area known as the Levant. Strikingly, the mummies were more closely related to ancient Europeans and Anatolians than to modern Egyptians. [3]</p>
                <p><br>The researchers cautioned that the affinities of the examined ancient Egyptian specimens may not be representative of those of all ancient Egyptians since they were from a single archaeological site.</p>
                <p><br>However, this isn&#8217;t to say that Egypt did not have black kings. From 747 BC until 656 BC Egypt was ruled by Nubian kings after the Nubian invasion. The 25th Dynasty of Egypt, or the Nubian Dynasty, was ruled by a line of kings from the Kingdom of Kush who were black skinned. </p>
                <p>Conspiracy theories still riddle the internet with misinformation. One particularly common one is that the noses were removed from every statue to cover the fact that the people had wider noses as is common in sub-Saharan facial features. This can easily be disproven by looking into an art history book and seeing how most statues do have noses. However, that isn&#8217;t to say that noses weren&#8217;t intentionally destroyed from some pieces. It is believed that this was for an iconoclastic purpose and not race related. This is similar to the many other destroyed images throughout Egypt, as it was through their image that the magic essence of the Pharaoh was thought to survive. </p>
                <p>Today, mainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a civilization of either white or black people, stating that applying modern notions like these to ancient Egypt is anachronistic. [4] Instead, ancient Egypt is viewed as racially homogeneous; skin color varied between people of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who in various eras rose to power in ancient Egypt.</p>
                <p><br>Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today, with a gradation of darker shades toward the Sudan [5] </p>
                <p>Many people of different nationalities find themselves enthralled by ancient Egypt&#8217;s beautiful and fascinating history, artwork, writing and culture. It&#8217;s important that we remind ourselves that Kemet and its people were a mix of many different cultures and lands. </p>
                <p>Many of the negative and misinformed comments and hours of wasted time arguing online could be solved by properly educating ourselves; and if so inclined, this text can be shared for the sake of saving time as all resources are linked below.</p>
