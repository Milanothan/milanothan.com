Among the many treasures onboard was one in particular that is considered to be worth even more than the Mona Lisa by modern scholars. The Antikythera Mechanism.</p>

                    <p style="padding: 35px 0px 0px 0px;"><b>The Discovery</b></p>
                    <p>The shipwreck would remain undiscovered for centuries until the spring of 1900 when a crew of sponge divers on their way to the fishing grounds off North Africa elected to stop and wait for more favorable winds. Their layover was on the Greek island of Antikythera.</p>
                    <p>During their wait, the crew set out with copper helmet and canvas suit to explore the ocean floor and nearby depths. Descending 45 meters (148ft), diver Elias Stadiatis began to signal with haste that he was ready to be pulled to surface.</p>
                    <p>Once out of the water, he claimed to have witnessed heaps upon heaps of rotting corpses, both of men and horses. All of them, he said, strewn together amid the rocks of the seafloor.</p>
                    <p>Captain Dimitrios Kondos believed that Elias was in fact intoxicated from the nitrogen used in his breathing mix and only hallucinated the nightmarish vision. Taking a helmet for himself, the Captain descended into the depths before soon returning to the surface with the bronze arm of a statue.</p>

                    <br>
                   <p>The crew soon departed as planned but after the season ended, they again stopped in the same area of Antikythera and retrieved artifacts before reporting the finds to authorities in Athens.</p>
                   <p><b>Retrieval amid the wreckage</b></p>
                   <p>Vessels were soon sent to support the salvage and over the next few months the sponge divers worked together with the Royal Hellenic Navy and Greek Education Ministry to salvage numerous artifacts from the waters.</p>
                    <p>Soon the teams had recovered many artifacts along with much of the ship's equipment. All of the findings were taken to the National Archaeology Museum in Athens for storage and analysis.</p>
                    <p>The death of one diver and the paralysis of two others caused by decompression sickness put the work to a stop and the wreck remained untouched for many years ; however the most important piece had already been found and was waiting to be examined at the National Archaeology Museum in Athens.</p>
                    <p>The piece appeared as a corroded lump of bronze and wood, remaining unnoticed for nearly two years as museum staff worked on more obvious reconstructions and analysis. That is until May 17th 1902, when archaeologist Valerios Stais noticed that this piece of bronze had a gear wheel embedded into it as well as Greek inscriptions that were still legible. </P>
                    <p>Valerios Stais believed that this was part of an astronomical clock, however the general agreement between scholars at the time was that nothing so complex could have possibly been constructed during the same time period as the other pieces discovered.</p>
                    <p>Interest and investigation into the mysterious device withered down and for another 50 years mankind would dismiss the knowledge of the ancients. </p>

                    <p><b>Analysis</b></p>    
                    <p>As fascinating as the artifact was, it wouldn't spark the same curiosity until 1952 when a professor at Yale university, Derek J. de Solla Price, took an interest in the object. Nineteen years later he and Charalampos Karakalos, a Greek nuclear physicist, would take X-ray and gamma-ray images of the fragments. Two years after that in 1974 they would publish a very detailed 70-page paper which they titled <a href="https://amzn.to/3fT2fTw" class="ulLink" target="_blank">Gears from the Greeks. The Antikythera Mechanism: A Calendar Computer from ca. 80 B. C.</a> In this publication we learn the true power of the ancient artifact through it's intricate design and mechanics.</p>
<p>The device itself is a hand power orrey once used for the prediction of astronomical positions and eclipses with accuracies that could foresee up to around 500 years into the future.</p>
<p>Although initially the mechanism first appeared as a single piece when brought out of the depths, it soon fractured into three major pieces. Over time other pieces fell off during handling and cleaning, and throughout the years more pieces have been discovered and more are still waiting to be analyzed in museum storage. Currently the artifact is divided into 82 fragments.
Four of these fragments contain gears - many other fragments contain inscriptions. </p>
<p>The inscriptions were best preserved on the surfaces that were protected while the artifact was submerged. The writing itself helped researches better understand the uses of the device as well as aided in dating the device itself to somewhere between 200 BC and 90 BC. More about the inscriptions can be learned in this 2008 article from <a href="https://currentepigraphy.org/2008/09/24/inscriptions-on-the-antikythera-mechanism-1/" class="ulLink" target="_blank">Current Epigraphy</a></p>

<p><b>How it Works</b></p>
<p>The entire mechanism was originally held in a wooden box <em>(approx.  340 x 180 x 90mm)</em> that was covered with bronze plates on both the front and back that contained inscriptions describing the cosmology it simulates.</p>
<p>Writing on the bronze panel at the back contains some instructions and functional explanations as well as an explanation for what the user is seeing. The writing does not go into advanced details, which indicates that a degree of prior knowledge was to be expected.</p>
<p>On the front face, the mechanism has a fixed ring dial to represent the earth's orbit around the sun; the twelve zodiac signs are marked with equal 30-degree sectors. Inscriptions both above and below the central dials listed the coming and going of stars.</p>
<p>Outside of that dial is another ring, this one rotatable, with the days and months of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3xC1J2b" class="ulLink" target="_blank">Egyptian calendar</a> (twelve months, each 30 days long - plus five "leap" days). The inscriptions on these parts contained the Egyptian names for the months transcribed with the Greek alphabet.</p>
<p>The mechanism once had a small hand crank that would be used to rotate the second wheel via a crown gear which connected to three additional gears. By rotating the Egyptian calendar wheel, one could align the date pointer to the correct Egyptian calendar day. 
This could be achieved because the crank was able to move the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; padding: 50px 10px 10px 10px;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IT0gXa1ZrnA" title="YouTube video player" class="youtube" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>If the user did not know what year the mechanism was set to, the only alternative would be to refer to ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set. These would always be in reference to the Babyloanian ephemeris tables. To the Greeks, the ancient astronomers of Mesopotamia were considered highly specialized scribes and masters of divination. In fact, all Western efforts in astronomy and the exact sciences can also find their origins in Mesopotamian writings.</p>

<p>When the hand crank was turned every interlocking gear would also rotate; this made it possible for the simultaneous calculations of the Sun and Moon's position, the moon phase, the next eclipse, calendar cycles, and planetary movement.</p>

<p>The center display contains seven spheres representing the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. These spheres would move with the use of the hand crank and their orbital distance could then be calculated by the sphere's position on the pointer pins.</p>

<p>The single hand-operated crank on the side of the box drove the complex gearing system - within which consisted of some 40 gears stacked in layers with gaps measuring as little as 1.4 mm per gear. The thinnest gear was just 1.0 mm and the thickest 2.7 mm. </p>

<p>With this precise and complex ancient engineering, the ancient mechanism performed computations and calculations with outputs that would then be displayed for the user's information on the dials. This is why the Antikythera mechanism is considered an early mechanical analog computer.</p>

<p>It was designed to calculate astronomical positions and it did so with a precision that would not be seen for thousands of years.</p>

<p><b>The origins of the mechanism and it's inventor</b></p>
<p>It is known that the mechanism uses Hipparchus of Nicaea's theory for the motion of the moon. This could suggest that the Greek astronomer, known as the founder of trigonometry, may have had a hand in its design, if not designed it himself. Unfortunately no information beyond speculation can be declared with the current information available.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most curious notes is that the Antikythera mechanism is one of a kind. No prototypes have ever been found, though many agree that a device of this level of sophistication must have a prototype.</p>

<p>A 2014 study argued that perhaps a more approximate date for the mechanisms origin would be closer to the year 200 BC based on identifying the fact that the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00407-014-0145-5" class="ulLink" target="-blank">eclipse predictor points to a start-up date of the new moon on April 28 205 BC</a></p>

<p>An astrophysicist at Athens University by the name of Xenophon Moussas, theorized in 2006 that the cargo ship may have been on its way to Rome for some lavish festivity hosted by Julius Ceaser in the 1st century BC. Another theory is that the ship was transporting plundered booty from the sacking of Athens in 87-86 BC. Unfortunately the ship's path has been extremely troublesome to determinate as the Aegean was such a well traveled and busy place at the time.</p>

<p>The origins of this device happens to be as mysterious as the mechanism itself. Only further research and time will give us more insight and answers into the true origin of the Antikythera mechanism.</p>

<p><b>The future of the mechanism</b></p>
<p>While many more pieces could still be waiting in museum storage to be identified, it is believed that many more pieces are still awaiting discovery at the original underwater archaeological site.</p>

<p>The last large exploration was in 1976 when Jacques Cousteau and his team investigated the site and discovered over 300 previously missed artifacts. Since then, little work has been done. In 2012 marine archaeologists again explored the area, now using the most technologically advanced scuba gear available. What they discovered was a massive spread of amphorae and other artifacts, which means that either the wreckage was much larger than originally thought, or a second wreck could be in the depths alongside.</p>

<p>Excavations are ongoing and new information is being presented constantly. </p>
