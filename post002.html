             <p><span class="capLetter">T</span>he origin of the Tarot is a mysterious and scattered history that has arguably existed in one form or another since the dawn of civilization. Certainly that last sentence might raise the eyebrow of the modern historian; however new research is emerging that might soon change our knowledge on the origins of Tarot.</p>
                           
              <p>Today tarot is mostly known by the massive variety of decks available from crystal shops and online merchants. Most decks are now used for fortune telling and divination by practitioners of various faiths and beliefs.</p>



              <p>It’s difficult to say what the cards were originally intended for, though it’s clear that they have always had a mystic air about them as far back as history narrates.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The earliest known written records of the cards can be traced only as far back as 1367, and these records are mostly regarding the banning of the cards. The first documented origin of the cards discovered was from Mamluk Sultanate, a medieval realm that covered Egypt, the Levant and Hejaz. This is usually the year that modern scholars agree the cards originated, not without debate.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>In 1377 a Dominican friar named John of Rheinfelde published <em>Ludus cartularum moralisatus</em>, in which he describes the deck as it is known to us today. That is 4 suits of 13 cards and the courts.&nbsp;</p>
              
              
              
              <p>While John’s work covered the art and usage of the tarot cards, he specifically states that he doesn&#8217;t know the origins of them. Interestingly he also states that these decks were everywhere: “the children play on the streets with them&#8221;</p>
              
              
              
              <p>This is a contradiction to modern scholarly belief, as historians today claim that the tarot was most likely first created ten years prior in 1367. <sub><sup>[1]</sup></sub> It would not be possible for the cards to have spread to so many people so rapidly during these times long before mass market manufacturing. Additionally decks would have been considered a novelty if they were only first created a decade prior to John&#8217;s work.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>What’s notable about John of Rheinfelde’s work is that he describes little about the games and uses involved with the cards and much to do with the symbolism and imagery of them. This is very similar to the works of Marziano da Tortona (? &#8211; 1425), in which the description focuses more on the figures than the rules or technical details of the games involved. <sub><sup>[2]</sup></sub></p>
              
              
              
              IMG
              
              
              <p>This focus in the art over the games is also recognized later in Hermetic Qabalah, which would become the basis for 18th century occult paths such as Thelema and the Golden Dawn. In such practices, the art and symbolism of the cards were considered sacred and of greater focus.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>This similarity in regards to preference is often overlooked as modern historians argue that the tarot was not used for mysticism until the 18th century when Hermetic Qabalah authors argued a link between tarot and traditional Kabbalah.*</p>
              
              
              
              <p>Sometime shortly after 1418 but before his death in 1425, Martiano da Tortona described a 60 card deck with 16 of the images having Roman Gods and suits depicting four kinds of birds. [2] Other decks would later even expand to include the &#8220;four elements&#8221; and astrological symbology. (You can read more on Martiano’s descriptions in the reference <sub><sup>[3])</sup></sub></p>
              
              
              
              <p>This leads one to believe that perhaps the methods incorporated by Hermetic Qabalah in the 18th century may indeed date back further, as is suggested in literature from Crowley, Fortune, Waite and many other practitioners and authors involved in this study of mysticism.</p>
              
              
              
              IMG
              
              
              <p>The credentials of Aleister Crowley are questionable to say the least. While Crowley may never be proven to be a total genius or a clever charlatan (perhaps both?), there were many other authors both then and now, who discuss a link between the Tarot and the Tree of Life as presented in traditional Kabbala.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>For the reader not yet familiar with the tree of life, often referred to as the Kabbalistic tree of life, I have presented an image and explanation below.&nbsp;</p>
              
              
              
              IMG
              
              
              <p>Essentially, the tree of life is a diagram that consists of 10 spheres arranged into three columns.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>The spheres, or &#8220;sephiroth&#8221; represent different aspects of reality, consciousness, divinity, numbers, colors, celestial bodies, feelings, thoughts, emotions; even the makings of time, space and all realities.&nbsp;</p>
              
              
              
              <p>The paths represent the links and roads to these various concepts, as well as electric charges and values.&nbsp;They are considered a guide from one <em>sephiroth </em>to the other in connecting the microcosm and macrocosm.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>The reader is encouraged to delve deeper into the concept of the tree of life through other means, as this text will not make an attempt to further explain the immensely complex understandings of the Kabbalistic tree of life. The diagram is much more complex than my limited words and wisdom could hope to convey; however for the sake of this text, I will move on and trust that the information present is sufficient. </p>
              
              
              
              <p>With this minimal description of the Tree of Life, one can see how these authors linked the tarot to the tree. The Major Arcana or “Greater Mysteries” (The 22 cards being the 21 Trumps as well as the Fool) are thought to correspond with the 22 paths of the tree of life. This also connects with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, long considered to be a sacred language.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>The ace to ten cards of each suite correspond with the ten spheres in the four Qabalistic worlds. Finally, the sixteen court cards relate to the classic elements in the four worlds.&nbsp; This could indicate that contrary to accepted belief, the tarot cards were originally created for the purpose of mysticism and only later used for games, before again returning to the realm of mysticism in the 18th century.</p>
              
              
              
              <p>While this representation of the tree of life is historically only dated to 1516 <sub>[4]</sub>, scholars believe that the concept of a tree of life matching the description given above can be traced back to 9th Century BC Assyria! <sup>(see opening image)</sup> <sup><sub>[5][6]</sub></sup></p>
              
              
              
              <p>The Assyrians assigned values and numbers to their deities much like Kabbalah would do later with divine concepts. The Assyrians had a stylized tree with obvious religious significance that is found everywhere in the ancient Near East including Egypt, Greece, and the Indus civilization. <sub><sup>[5]</sup></sub></p>
              
              
              
              IMG
              
              
              <p>The Tree of Life seems to be found in a very diverse range of cultures and religions afterwards, ranging from Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism to many more both living and dead faiths. Interestingly, the tree of life often fits in with the great mysteries and enlightenments of these faiths. <sup><sub>[7]</sub></sup></p>
              
              
              
              <p>If the early tarot decks were indeed based on the tree of life as evidence seems to dictate, this would mean that the tarot can one day be traced back to the dawn of civilization. While the cards themselves most likely would not have been created for thousands of years after, the concepts of tarot seem more and more likely to  be traced back to the the Assyrians. Could the tree of life and the ideas behind them go back even further? Only time will tell. </p>
              
              
              
              <p>While such a claim will still require more research; new evidence is emerging that will hopefully one day solve the mystery of these mystic cards and their yet to be understood origin and purpose. Until then, we can only try and piece the puzzle together with the information that scholars and archeologists have unearthed.</p>
