                    <p style="padding: 25px 0px 0px 0px;"><span class="capLetter">A</span>lthough Mary Magdalene’s historic existence is still under debate today, Christian text from sources including the New Testament tell us that Mary of Magdala (her home village on the shore of the Sea of Gailee) played a significant role in the life of Jesus Christ and the foundations of Christianity as it is known today.</p>
                    <p>According to legend, Mary was one of the women that stayed with Jesus even up to crucifixion. She is said to be the first one whom Jesus appeared to after resurrection. Other early Christian texts raise her status even more in that after the death of Christ she is considered almost an apostle rivaling the status of Saint Peter.</p>

                    <p style="padding: 35px 0px 0px 0px;">The New Testament tells us that the followers of Christ were prosecuted from the Holy Land after his death and many of them were forced out to sea in small ships without sail or rudder where they were left to perish on their own. The most common version of the legend states that Mary Magdalene was sent with Mary Salomé, Mary Jacobé, Martha, Lazarus, Maximin, and their Egyptian servant Sara into one of these ships.</p>
                    <p>After a seemingly hopeless battle at sea, the ship was guided by divine force to Provence in a place now called Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer (Saints Mary of the Sea).</p>
                    <p>The followers went their separate ways while Mary Magdalene joined Lazarus in converting the people of Marseille to Christianity before continuing into the lonely grotto in the mountains farther east.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>She would go on to spend 30 years in prayer and penance here. It is said that she felt that her time was coming to an end and so she would make her way to Aix-en-Provence in search of communion from saint Maximin. This is also said to have become her final resting place.</p>
                    <p>In the year 1279, rumor began to emerge that Mary Magdalene’s remains were in the south of France from a well published discovery.</p>
                    <p>The story states that during renovations to the basilica, a series of first century tombs were discovered including one marble sarcophagus.</p>
                    <p>The Count of Provence, Charles II, claimed that in a dream, Saint Mary Magdalene appeared to him and he was driven by this divine sight to have the excavation conducted.</p>
                    <p>The lid was removed and accounts of this event insist that a sweet and pleasant smell came out of the sarcophagus. The smell was compared symbolically to the oil and perfume Mary Magdalene anointed Jesus’ feet with in tradition.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, the story claims that a note in a wax covered tablet stating “<em>Hic requiescit corpus beatae Mariae Magdalenae</em>” (Here is the body of the blessed Mary Magdalene) was also found. This tablet is estimated to be from between the 1st and 4th centuries.</p>
                    <p>And finally, a papyrus was found which read:</p>
                    <p class="blockqouteStyle">The year of the birth of the Lord 710, the sixth day of December, at night and very secretly, under the reign of the very pious Eudes, king of the Franks, during the time of the ravages of the treacherous nation of the Saracens, the body of the dear and venerable St. Mary Magdalene was, for fear of the said treacherous nation, moved from her alabaster tomb to the marble tomb, after having removed the body of Sidonius, because it was more hidden.</p>
                    <p>After this discovery Charles II began construction on the Gothic Basilique Ste. Marie-Madeleine with the blessings of pope Boniface VIII. Upon completion, the skull was placed on display where it can still be viewed to this day under the crypt.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, there is just not enough research or data on the remains to determine if this was actually Mary Magdalene. But Philippe Charlier, a biological anthropologist, and Philippe Froesch, a visual forensic artist, have nonetheless reconstructed the face based on over 500 photos they took of the skull.</p>

                    <p>The technology used for this reconstruction is the same technology that the FBI uses in crime scene investigation.</p>
                    <p>They were able to note that the skull belonged to a woman who died somewhere in or just before her 50s and was of Mediterrenean descent. The features such as nose shape and other angular data were determined using trigonometric ratios based on characteristics consistent with the skull’s age, sex, and ethnicity.</p>
                    <p>The hair tone was based on hair found on the skull, and the skin color was based on tones typically seen in Mediterrenean women.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, despite evidence from legend and text, there is no data to confirm that this is actually Mary Magdalene. Remains of Mary Magdalene have been “found” at least five times in other regions according to Rebecca Lea McCarthy who wrote Origins of the Magdalene Laundries.</p>
                    <p>“We are absolutely not sure that this is the true skull of Mary Magdalene,” says Philippe.</p>
                    <p>Charlier states that he would like to conduct more research with the skull outside of the glass case that now holds it. More data, such as carbon dating, could one day tell us if this could truly be Mary Magdalene; however any request to remove the skull has been blocked by the Catholic Church.</p>
